This is a library that enables you to identify songs stored in the database with simple recordings of given lengths. Most of the code is highly modifiable to use different neighborhoods, fanout patterns, and iterate_structures, so users can modify it.

There is a prerequisite library called `Microphone` that can be found and installed here: https://github.com/CogWorksBWSI/Microphone
